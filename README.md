# Breast-Cancer-Analysis-Using-kernel-SVM

This project leverages the breast cancer dataset found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data to explore the application of kernel Support Vector Machines (SVM) for diagnosis prediction.

The primary goal was to analyze the dataset's features and understand their potential in training an effective SVM model. After a thorough data cleaning process, the refined dataset was used to train a kernel SVM model, aiming to predict breast cancer diagnoses accurately.
